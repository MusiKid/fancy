# Fan Configuration

It is possible to create/edit them with the GUI (coming soon!).

## Path

Configurations should be located at `/etc/fancy/configs`.
It will soon be possible to add them from other locations.

## Formats

Fan configurations from NBFC, nbfc-revive and nbfc-linux are fully supported
(which means XML and JSON). It is possible to add support for virtually
every format, if there is enough demand for it (and a Serde package!).
Open an issue if you think that it would be **really useful** to add another format.
